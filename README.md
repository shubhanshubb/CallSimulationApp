- Provides call and video call buttons for each contact.

### Incoming Call Simulation
- Automatically simulates an incoming call 2 seconds after launching the app.

### Audio and Video Call Modes
- Switch between audio and video calls.
- Access the deviceâ€™s camera during video calls.

### In-Call Controls
- Mute/unmute the microphone.
- Switch between front and back cameras.
- End the call.

### Calling UI
- Displays caller's name and avatar during the call.
- "Calling..." indicator during call setup.
